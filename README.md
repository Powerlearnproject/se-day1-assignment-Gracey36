Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  It is a systematic process of creating high quality software products using methods, tools and engineering principles. It is important because it helps in creating quality 
  innovations that fulfil users needs.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  Development of programming languanges such as C, C++, Lisp
  Introduction of Structured programming
  Rise of agile methodologies


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  Requrements analysis- Involves gathering information about user needs and system requirements.
  System design- Involves creating high level and detailed designs of the system architecture.
  Implementation- Building the design according to the specifications which involves writing the code.
  Testing- Checking if the designed system meets the specified requirements.
  Deployment- Releasing the software to the market.
  Maintainance- Continuous support, updates and improvements after deployment.
  

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  Waterfall methodology follows a sequential series of steps for example in food processing one step has to be completed before beginning another.
  Agile methodology follows an iterative and incremental approach that focuses on responding to change and user feedback for example in mobile phone production; the team 
   could complete a phase then check for user adaptation and feedback and implement necessary changes before moving to the next step.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
 Software Developer is responsible for implementing the system and writing the code.
 Quality Assurance Engineer is responsible for testing the software and checking to ensure it meets high quality design.
 Project manager is responsible for planning, execution and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
 IDEs are tools that are used for writing, testing and debugging code for example Visual Studio, Eclipse.
 Version Control Systems are used for tracking to code and collaborating with team members for example GitHub.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  Technical debt- Use agile methodology during design to avoid shortcuts.
  Changing requirements- Ensure effective communication within the team and with the clients to avoid changing requirements.
  Time contraints- Prioritize taks and work as a team to avoid time pressure and unmet deadlines.
  

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 Unit testing involves testing individual components of the system.
 Integration testing involves testing the interaction between the components of the system.
 System testing involves testing the entire system for bugs an errors.
 Acceptance testing involves testing the system against user requiremnts to ensure it meets their needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 Prompt engineering is creating and crafting questions and statements in order to get the best responses from an AI.
 It is important as it helps the AI to provide clear and concise responses hence avoiding confusion. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  Vague prompt-" Tell me how to write codes in programming"
  Improved prompt- " Explain to me using an example, how to write a HELLO WORLD code in Java."
  The second prompt will give a clear response concerning Java as a programming language and also give an example of how to write the hello world code, unlike the first 
   which would have given multiple general answers.
